Its a dead-simple Recording application which helps you prepare for *speaking sessions* ,be it for interviews, lectures or even for recitals at school !I personally use it to practise my english for Toefl and for practising poerty recitals for my friend .

**pip install Recorder**

If you have the 'requried' packages [be extra extra curious to know about it :p ]
just clone it and type python app.py

It was written using **Tkinter** .(sorry for the 95-ish graphics , and its derivatives .
It uses port audio api (**PyAudio**) .
It also uses **Pickledb** for database maintainence.

I did this because i did not find any decent apps in software center that records voice and stores them . without pesky other'business'es.
