Its a dead-simple Recording application which helps you prepare for speaking sessions ,be it for interviews, lectures or even for recitals at school !I personally use it to practise my english for Toefl and ,well, for practising poerty for my girlfriend .
Do Check out the Screen Shots.

It wont run on windows ! :( due to its pyaudio dependency.

INSTALL
----------------
sudo pip install VoiceRecorder



FOR NERDS
----------------
It was written using Tkinter .(sorry for the 95-ish graphics , and its derivatives .
It uses port audio api .
It also uses Pickledb for database maintainence.
